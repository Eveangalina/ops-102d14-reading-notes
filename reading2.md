**2. What details are you looking for when finding a motherboard which fits your processor?**
   -You are checking to see if the sockets in the CPU and motherbboard fit. You are also chekcing to ensure your motherboard supports wifi, bluetooth, high RAM capacity and PCIe slots.
**3. What are the tradeoffs you’d evaluate while selecting a storage device?**
   -You can choose between HDD Hard Disk Drive(7200 RPM), or SSD Solid State Drive (faster, smaller, no moving parts)
**4. Think about others with a background similar to yours. How would you explain to them the key parts of a computer, in a way they’d best connect with?**
-The key fuctions of a computer are input, processing and output. That being said the key parts will be the CPU, Central Processing Unit, and the motherboard which serves as a platform to do all three. The motherboard contains the input and output hardware as well as the main, central processing unit.
