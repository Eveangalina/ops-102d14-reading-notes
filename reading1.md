# Hardware vs Software attack

*Case Study: China’s Spy Chip*

### 1. How is a hardware hack different than a software hack?
**A hardware hack is an attack on one or more of the computers physical components. A software attack would be an attack on one of the computers Operating Systems.**
### 2. What are the two ways for spies to alter a computer’s hardware? 
**One way spies could alter a computer's hardware is through interception durring the manufacturing process. Another way that spies could alter a computer's hardware is by adding additional external components for the purpose of infultrating the operating system.**

### 3. Explain how the hack worked. 
**Supermicro intercepted the motherboards durring the manufacturing process and installed spy chips disguised as signal conditioning couplers. The chips were connected to the baseboard management controller, which gives access to the most sensitive codes even on machines that have crashed or turned off. This chip was altering the information being sent to the CPU, therefor altering the commands that the CPU executes.**


### 4. How were investigators able to trace the chips back to the source? 
**The investigators were able to trace the chips back to the source through serial numbers, manifests and invoices that all tracked back to their respective factories of origin.**

## Things I want to know more about / other notes
**Growth Mindset**
- Positive thinking
- Remember that the challenging times are for growth.
- 'Only through adversity comes new birth and diversity'
- We learn most in the 'hole'/'learning pit'
  **What is a Computer?**
-a machine that takes and follows instruction precisely
**Levels of Abstraction**
The amount of complexity by which a system is viewed/programed
-Higher levels → less detail (entire system / cloud)
-Lower levels → more detail (components on motherboard; integrated circuts, transistors, resistors, capaciors, or other electronic components)
**Key Computer Components**
-Hardware -tangible physical components 
-Operating System (OS) control layer/ software that manages the hardware.
*bios transfers control from the hardware to the OS. *F12 and F11 keys are working through the OS. 
**Stages of Computing**
-Three fundamentals that facilitate functionality. 
1. <u>INPUT</u> - key clicking
2. <u>PROCESSING</u> - once input is given, OS instructs the hardware to process the input info.
3. <u>OUTPUT</u> - when the computer...
**Circuts & Logic**
 -0 and 1 ; on and off
 -circuts on the board serve as building blocks for processing
**Binary & Data**
- earliest computers were designed to be a calculator, for math calculations.
**Smallest unit of data is in BITS - smalest piece of data that can be tracked, electricity on or elec. off. 
BITE is 8 Bits**
-read numbers from right to left, far right didget is in the ones place
(1) 0=0
(2) 1=2
(4) 1=4
(8)
(16)
(32)
(64)
(128)
-RAM is short term memory
