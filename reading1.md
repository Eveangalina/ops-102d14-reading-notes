## Growth Mindset
- Positive thinking
- Remember that the challenging times are for growth.
- 'Only through adversity comes new birth and diversity'
- We learn most in the 'hole'/'learning pit'
## What is a Computer?
-a machine that takes and follows instruction precisely
## Levels of Abstraction
The amount of complexity by which a system is viewed/programed
-Higher levels → less detail (entire system / cloud)
-Lower levels → more detail (components on motherboard; integrated circuts, transistors, resistors, capaciors, or other electronic components)
### Key Computer Components 
-Hardware -tangible physical components 
-Operating System (OS) control layer/ software that manages the hardware.
*bios transfers control from the hardware to the OS. *F12 and F11 keys are working through the OS. 
### Stages of Computing
-Three fundamentals that facilitate functionality. 
1. <u>INPUT</u> - key clicking
2. <u>PROCESSING</u> - once input is given, OS instructs the hardware to process the input info.
3. <u>OUTPUT</u> - when the computer...
 ### Circuts & Logic
 -0 and 1 ; on and off
 -circuts on the board serve as building blocks for processing
 ### Binary & Data
- earliest computers were designed to be a calculator, for math calculations.
## Smallest unit of data is in BITS - smalest piece of data that can be tracked, electricity on or elec. off. 
## BITE is 8 Bits. 
-read numbers from right to left, far right didget is in the ones place
(1) 0=0
(2) 1=2
(4) 1=4
(8)
(16)
(32)
(64)
(128)
-RAM is short term memory
